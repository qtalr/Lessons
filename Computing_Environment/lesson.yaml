# Overview ---------------------------------------------------------------

- Class: text
  Output: This lesson we will discuss how to safeguard your computing environment for sharing as part of a reproducible research project.

- Class: text
  Output: "Don't forget that you can, temporarily, leave the lesson by typing `play()` and then return by typing `nxt()`. You can also completely stop a lesson by typing `bye()` or hitting `CTRL + C`."

# Why Reproducibility Matters -----------------------------------------------------

- Class: text
  Output: Reproducible research ensures others can verify and recreate your work. Key aspects include reliability (consistent results across environments), credibility (others can validate without hidden dependencies), and stability (code works long-term despite software updates).

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which is NOT a benefit of reproducibility?
  AnswerChoices: Faster debugging;Academic credibility;Hardware independence;Temporary convenience
  CorrectAnswer: Temporary convenience
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Temporary convenience')
  Hint: Think about long-term vs short-term advantages.

# Computing Environment Components -------------------------------------------------

- Class: text
  Output: A computing environment consists of several key components that affect reproducibility - Hardware, Operating System, Software dependencies (including R), R packages, and the Research compendium structure.

- Class: text
  Output: While we can't control all aspects (like hardware), we can document and standardize many components to improve reproducibility, including the R and R package versions. We will explore how to 'pin' R and R package versions with {renv}.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's check your R version. Type 'R.version$version.string'
  CorrectAnswer: R.version$version.string
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='R.version$version.string')
  Hint: Just type exactly what's shown to see your R version information.

# Pinning R packages with {renv} -------------------------------------------------------

- Class: text
  Output: "Pinning packages refers to establishing a link between a particular version of a package and maintaining that connection over time. This is important as software changes over time, including R packages. These changes may introduce breaking changes and render your project's code inoperable at some point in the future. The {renv} package aims to address this issue."

- Class: text
  Output: "To initialize {renv} in our project, all we do is call 'renv::init()'." 

- Class: text
  Output: "After initializing {renv}, it creates a lockfile (renv.lock) that records the exact versions of packages used in your project. You can update this lockfile with 'renv::snapshot()' whenever you add or update packages."

- Class: text
  Output: "To check if your project's packages match what's recorded in the lockfile, you can use 'renv::status()'. This helps identify any discrepancies."

- Class: text
  Output: "When sharing your project, you should include the lockfile in your Git/GitHub repository. The local R library is NOT added to version control - it will be recreated from the lockfile using 'renv::restore()'."

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Which command would you use to update the lockfile after installing a new package?"
  AnswerChoices: renv::init();renv::snapshot();renv::restore();renv::install()
  CorrectAnswer: renv::snapshot()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='renv::snapshot()')
  Hint: Think about which command captures the current state of your packages.

- Class: text
  Output: "Best practices for using {renv} include: regular updates to the lockfile, sharing the lockfile with collaborators, and including it in version control. This ensures everyone working on the project uses the same package versions."

# Hands-on Practice with {renv} -------------------------------------------------------

# TODO: add with project in tmp/ directory later 

# Integration with Research Workflow -------------------------------------------------------

- Class: text
  Output: "The {renv} package is just one part of a reproducible research workflow. It works best when combined with version control (Git), containerization (Docker), and a well-structured research compendium."

- Class: text
  Output: "When sharing your research, include the renv.lock file in your repository. Others can then use 'renv::restore()' to recreate your exact package environment."

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Which of the following is NOT typically included in version control when using {renv}?"
  AnswerChoices: renv.lock file;R script files;renv/library/ directory;.Rprofile
  CorrectAnswer: renv/library/ directory
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='renv/library/ directory')
  Hint: Think about which components are large and can be recreated from other files.

- Class: text
  Output: "Congratulations! You've completed the Computing Environment lesson. You now understand the basics on using {renv} to create reproducible R environments for your research projects."
