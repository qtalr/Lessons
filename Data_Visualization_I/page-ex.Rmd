## Instructions

To create a new page for a swirl lesson, do the following:

1. Copy and rename the `page-ex.R` 
2. Edit the contents to represent the .html file you want to display in the lesson
3. Copy and rename the `page-ex.Rmd` file
4. Edit the contents to represent the .Rmd file you want to display in the lesson
5. Knit the .Rmd file to create the .html file
6. Add a lesson of class `figure` to the lesson yaml file, example below

```yaml
- Class: figure
  Output: Check out this content!
  Figure: page-ex.R
  FigureType: new
```

## Show code example

Here's a code example with highlighing. It will not execute in the lesson, but it will be visible to the user.

```r
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Show plots

Now we'll show the plot that was created in the code example above.

```{r}
#| label: fig-plot-no-code
#| echo: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) +
  geom_point()
```
