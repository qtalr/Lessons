# Overview ----------------------------------------------

- Class: text
  Output: "In this lesson, we will get familiar with our workspace in RStudio. We will learn about the four main panes and how we can use them to write, run, and save our code. Let's get started!"

- Class: text
  Output: "Don't forget you can, temporarily, leave the lesson by typing play() and then return by typing nxt()."

# 1 RStudio IDE ------------------------------------------

- Class: text
  Output: "It is very important to understand the relationship between R and RStudio, or any IDE for that matter. R is a programming language and when you install R on your machine you are installing the R intpreter. This is the software that actually understands the R language and can execute the code you write."

- Class: text
  Output: "RStudio is an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment. It is a software application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for writing and running code. But any code that is run is actually run by the R interpreter."

- Class: text
  Output: "RStudio is just a helpful tool that makes it easier to write, run, and organize code and coding projects."

- Class: text_question
  Output: "T/F- All you need to run R code is to download RStudio."
  CorrectAnswer: "F"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='F')
  Hint: You need to download R first. RStudio is just an IDE that makes it easier to write, run, and organize code and coding projects.

- Class: text
  Output: "Let's look at the RStudio IDE when we first open it and explore the four main panes in a clockwise fashion, starting with the upper left pane."

# 2 Source pane ------------------------------------------

- Class: text
  Output: "The four main panes in RStudio are the Source, Console, Environment, and Files panes. Let's briefy look at each of these panes and what they are used for."

- Class: figure
  Output: "The source pane is located in the top left corner of the RStudio IDE. This is where we write our code with the intention to save that code into a file. A file which contains code is called a script."
  Figure: page-rs-source-pane.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: figure
  Output: "If you are opening RStudio for the first time, the source pane will be empty. Meaning that we do not have a file open in the source pane."
  Figure: page-rs-startup.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: "We can open a new file in the source pane a few different ways. One way is to use the RStudio menu bar. The other is to use the RStudio tool bar, which is a series of icons located just below the menu bar. And the third is to use keyboard shortcuts."

- Class: text
  Output: "Using either the menu or tool bar, we use the mouse to navigate and select the operation we want to perform. To the right of each operation is the keyboard shortcut for that operation. For example, to open a new file in the source pane, we can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + N."

- Class: figure
  Output: "Create an R script now by one of these three methods."
  Figure: page-rs-create-file.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: figure
  Output: "We can now clearly see that their are four panes in the RStudio IDE. The source pane is where we create, write, and save our code."
  Figure: page-rs-4-panes.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: "We are not limited to creating R scripts, but can also create Quarto documents, Shiny apps, and scripts for other languages like Python and SQL. In this course, we will focus on R scripts and Quarto documents."

- Class: text_question
  Output: "T/F- The source pane is for writing and saving R code only. It cannot be used to write code for other languages."
  CorrectAnswer: "F"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='F')
  Hint: We are not limited to creating R scripts, but can also create Quarto documents, Shiny apps, and scripts for other languages like Python and SQL.

# 3 Environment pane -------------------------------------

- Class: figure
  Output: "The environment pane is located in the top right corner of the RStudio IDE. This is the first of two panes that include a series of tabs. The environment pane has four sub-panes-  Environment, History, Connections, and Tutorials."
  Figure: page-rs-environment-pane.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: "The environment pane is where we can view all of the objects that we have created in our current R session. This includes variables, functions, datasets, etc. We can also view the values of these objects."

- Class: text
  Output: "As part of this lesson, I created four objects in the environment pane. `x_vec`, `y_vec`, and `z_df`."

- Class: text
  Output: "The History pane is where we can view all of the code that we have run in our current R session. There should be some code in the History pane if you have been following along with this lesson!"

- Class: text
  Output: "The Connections pane is where we can view any connections that we have established to external data sources, such as databases. This is more advanced and we will not cover this in this lesson."

- Class: text
  Output: "The Tutorials pane is where we can view any tutorials that we have installed. Tutorials are a new feature in RStudio and are a great way to learn R and RStudio."

- Class: text_question
  Output: "T/F- The environment pane is where we can view all of the objects that we have created in our current R session."
  CorrectAnswer: "T"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='T')
  Hint: The environment pane is where we can view all of the objects that we have created in our current R session.

- Class: figure
  Output: "Moving on to the next major pane, we see the Files pane directly underneath the Environment pane. Like the Enivronment pane, the Files pane also has sub-panes- Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer, and Presentations."
  Figure: page-rs-files-pane.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: "The files pane looks and behaves much like a file explorer in Windows or Finder in Mac. We can use it to navigate our file system and open files. We can also create new files and folders."

- Class: figure
  Output: "The plots pane is where we can view any plots that we have created in our current R session. When creating a plot in R, it will automatically appear in the plots pane and the pane will be activated."
  Figure: plot-ex.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: "The packages pane is where we can view all of the packages that we have installed on our machine. We can also install new packages or update existing packages."

- Class: text
  Output: "The help pane is where we can view documentation for R, and any packages that we have installed. This pane will be activated when we use the `help()` function or the `?` operator."

- Class: text
  Output: "The viewer pane is where we can preview any content we have generated by rendering Quarto documents or Shiny apps."

- Class: text
  Output: "The presentation pane is similar to the viewer pane, but is used to preview any content we have generated from Quarto documents that are intended to be presentations."

- Class: text_question
  Output: "T/F- The files pane is where we can view any plots that we have created in our current R session."
  CorrectAnswer: "F"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='F')
  Hint: The plots pane is where we can view any plots that we have created in our current R session.

# 4 Console pane -----------------------------------------

- Class: figure
  Output: "The console pane is located in the bottom left corner of the RStudio IDE. This is where we can run code and view the output of that code. We can also use the console pane to interact with R directly."
  Figure: page-rs-console-pane.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: "At this moment, you are following this Swirl lesson in the console pane."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "The console pane is comprised of three tabs- Console, Terminal, and Background Jobs."  

- Class: text
  Output: "The console is our direct line to the R interpreter."

- Class: text
  Output: "The terminal is a command line interface (CLI) that allows us to interact with our operating system."

- Class: text
  Output: "The background jobs tab is where we can view any background jobs that we have initiated."

- Class: text
  Output: "Of the three tabs, we will almost exclusively use the console tab."

- Class: text_question
  Output: "T/F- The console pane is where we can run code and view the output of that code."
  CorrectAnswer: "T"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='T')
  Hint: The console pane is where we can run code and view the output of that code.

# Summary -----------------------------------------------
