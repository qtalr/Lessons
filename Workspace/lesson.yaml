  Output: In this lesson, we will get familiar with our workspace in RStudio. We will learn about the four main panes and how we can use them to write, run, and save our code. We will also learn about RStudio Projects and how they can help us organize our work. With this in mind, let's get started!

- Class: text
  Output: RStudio is an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment. It is a software application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for writing and running code. But any code that is run is actually run by the R interpreter.

- Class: text
  Output: RStudio is just a helpful tool that makes it easier to write, run, and organize code and coding projects.

- Class: text
  Output: Let's look at the RStudio IDE when we first open it and explore the four main panes in a clockwise fashion, starting with the upper left pane.

- Class: text
  Output: The upper left pane is the **Source** pane. This is where we write our code with the intention to save that code into a file. A code file is called a script.

- Class: text
  Output: When we first open the source pane, we are presented with a blank script. We can write our code in this script and save it to our computer, create a new script, or open an existing script.

- Class: text
  Output: Different scripts will open in a new tab in the source pane. We can have multiple scripts open at the same time and jump between them by clicking on the tabs.

- Class: text
  Output: There's much more to know about the source pane, but we'll get to that later, for now, let's move on to the upper right pane.

- Class: text
  Output: The upper right pane is the **Environment** pane. This pane is one of two panes that are made up of a series of pane views. The environment pane by default includes - the environment, history, connections, and tutorials pane views.
